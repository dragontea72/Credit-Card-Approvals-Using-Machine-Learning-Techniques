# Credit-Card-Approvals-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
A number of applications for credit cards are received by commercial banks. For various factors, many of them are refused, such as high debt balances, low income levels, or too many questions into an individual's credit report, for instance. It is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming and time is money!) to manually analyze these applications. Luckily, with the power of machine learning, this activity can be automated and almost every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will create an automated credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.
We will work in existing data from UCI. We also use in the Credit Card Approval dataset from UCI machine learning repository.

This notebook follows the some instructions

- At first , we load and view the dataset.
- Here, we could see some numerical and categorical values.This valus are some missing , attributes are not relevant.In this section, we will analysis in this dataset from top to bottom.We will find what factors can impact in this dataset.
- We will have to preprocesses the data to ensure before implementing machine learning model and so that we can get better performance from my model.
- We will make visualize on the data cause visualize data can say a thousands of word in insights.
- We will evaluate performance the model.
- Then we will do hyperparameter tuning and optimization so that we can get better performance.
- We will also do comparison some machine learning model which model will give a better result.
